                        <p><span class="Edgar">Edgar Karl Alfons Ende</span> (23 February 1901 – 27 December 1965) was a German surrealist painter and father of the children’s novelist Michael Ende.

                            Ende attended the Altona School of Arts and Crafts from 1916 to 1920. In 1922 he married Gertrude Strunck, but divorced four years later. He remarried in 1929, the same year his son Michael was born. In the 1930s Ende’s Surrealist paintings began to attract considerable critical attention, but were then condemned as degenerate by the Nazi government. Beginning in 1936 the Nazis forbade him to continue to paint or exhibit his work. In 1940 he was conscripted into the Luftwaffe as an operator of anti-aircraft artillery.</p>
